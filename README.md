=========================================
In order to run these scripts, you must have the following .jar files:
junit-4.11.jar
selenium-java-2.25.0.jar
selenium-server-standalone-2.41.0.jar

Files have been uploaded.

To use the Remote Control, or 'RC' files, you need to:

MAC - Open Terminal and paste this command after all jar files are in place:
java -jar Desktop/selenium-server-standalone-2.41.0.jar -port 4444

PC - Open CMD and enter "cd C:\"

Then paste "java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.41.0.jar"
**Make sure "java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.41.0.jar" is on the DESKTOP.

Make sure the rest of the .jar(s) are stored in the Project workspace on the Desktop.

These are 7 automated testing scripts in 2 formats: Selenium JUnit Tests and Selenium Remote Control Tests.  There are tests for each format designed for Staging and Production.
